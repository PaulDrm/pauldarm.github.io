<h1>Why you should start feeling stupid – and why that is hopefully not a bad thing</h1>

<p>Last week was one for the history books in the advancement of AI. Both OpenAI and Google released their latest model updates, passing the most important current benchmark in AI: the vibe check. As I'm working in this field, I'd like to share my thoughts on why AI progress is accelerating, and why most people will soon feel "stupid" compared to state-of-the-art generative AI models.</p>

<h2>Recent AI Advancements</h2>

<p>On March 25th, OpenAI released a new version of their image generation model SORA integrated with ChatGPT-4o, capable of hyper-realistic photos and advanced instruction-following. See examples at <a href="https://sora.com">https://sora.com</a>.</p>

<p>Just one day later, Google released their model Gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25, achieving top scores in reasoning tasks on Livebench and outperforming recent models like Claude-3-7 and Deepseek-R1 significantly.</p>

<h2>Impact on Jobs and Society</h2>

<p>Generative AI, such as ChatGPT-4o, directly competes with graphic designers, digital artists, photo editors, and even software developers. An example of this trend is the recent "Ghiblivication," inspired by Studio Ghibli’s distinctive style, where anyone can instantly transform ideas into Ghibli-styled visuals.</p>

<p>Historically, we've seen technology surpass human capabilities, exemplified by AlphaGo defeating Lee Sedol, who later retired, recognizing he couldn't compete against an unbeatable entity.</p>

<h2>Future Outlook</h2>

<p>The trajectory of AI growth suggests increasingly intelligent models. Experts like Bill Gates and Geoffrey Hinton acknowledge that these models might soon surpass human intelligence, triggering societal shifts similar to the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<h2>Possible Solutions</h2>

<p>To manage this shift positively, one proposal is a tax on AI usage, redistributing profits to society, akin to a basic universal income. This could ensure everyone benefits from AI, preventing a scenario where only the wealthy gain significantly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Generative AI is reshaping our world rapidly. It’s important not to underestimate its potential and to develop policies ensuring AI benefits all, not just the few.</p>
